This update various bug fixes and improvements to the runtime environment

 - FIXED: PPM will now properly clean up left-over build files and downloads
 - NEW: Shared Libraries have been added allowing PPM to collect pre-compiled binaries for static builds
 - NEW: A custom include handler has been added, when running `require 'ppm'`, this will modify the runtimes
   include configuration to use PPM's custom include handler allowing you to import packages using `require` instead
   of PPM's builtin functions, example usages:

   require 'net.intellivoid.ziproto';
   require 'net.intellivoid.ziproto==latest';
   require 'net.intellivoid.ziproto==1.0.0.0';

   Missing packages or invalid versions will only result in the generic file not found error.
