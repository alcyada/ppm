This update introduces optimizations and bug fixes

 - The import function will now recursively import dependencies
 - PPM Will store the package lock configuration in memory rather than loading it each time from disk
 - Already-imported warnings are supressed by default

Updating PPM from 1.0.0.+ to 1.0.0.4 simply requires you to run the installer, previous package installations/packages
will be backwards compatible with this version and it will work as expected.
