This update introduces more compiler options, minor bug fixes and the ability to install composer packages
as PPM packages natively without needing to install composer on the system.

 - Updated the help menu to categorize the options and flags under sub-menus
 - Added option 'alm'
 - Added option 'lerror' and 'lwarning' for linting checks
 - Added option 'bcerror' and 'bcwarning' for byte-compiling
 - Added option 'cerror' and 'cwarning' for general compiler error handling
 - Updated the install script to install composer in the PPM installation directory
 - Added support for composer, you can install packages with this source syntax "vendor_name@composer/package_name"
 - GitHub vault now has a default profile, allowing you to install packages using the syntax "default@github/org/repo"
 - Added command 'github-set-default' to change the default alias used 
 - Updated the package dependency standard to specify how PPM can obtain missing dependencies using remote sources "source"
 - The package generator tool will not overwrite the autoloading method in the package configuration
 - Added compatibility tools for composer to convert composer package traits to PPM
 - Updated the version validation method to allow version formats with at least 2 parts, "1.0", "1.0.0" and "1.0.0.0" are
   now accepted as valid version numbers
 - Bug fix in the import function when attempting to import non-required dependencies that aren't installed
 - Added a new unusable autoloading method called "composer_generated" which is intended to use autoloader files generated by composer
 - Made autoloader generators more tolerable towards duplication errors
 - The clear cache tool will now clear composer cache data too
 - Added option 'install-native' for installing composer packages, this command will attempt to automatically generate
   and compile each package installed by composer as a native PPM package. This can cause unexpected issues while
   importing these packages because not all components may be compiled or imported correctly.
 - Updating packages will now update composer packages and their native install trait
