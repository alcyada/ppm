This update introduces a lot of improvements and new features

 - Added DirectoryScanner Class, ported from theseer
 - Added AutoloaderBuilder port from composer

Updating PPM from 1.0.0.+ to 1.1.0.0 simply requires you to run the installer, previous package installations/packages
will be backwards compatible with this version and it will work as expected.
