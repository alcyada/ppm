This update introduces minor bug fixes and optimizations

 - Bug fix in \ppm\Utilities\CLI > Tools > generatePackageJson() where Components and Files not being empty
 - Made PPM ASCII logo more whacky

Updating PPM from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 simply requires you to run the installer, previous package installations/packages
will be backwards compatible with this version and it will work as expected.
