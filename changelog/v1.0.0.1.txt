This update introduces minor bug fixes and optimizations

 - Added "files" to the package structure to allow for non-php files to be included in a package
 - Updated package generator to discover non-php files to include in the "files" property of a package
 - Partially corrected PackageManager to use options instead of bare-parameters
 - Added option "no_details" in PackageManager to omit package details during an update
 - Bug fix PackageManager when updating all packages and one package is not updated due to hard_failure not being set
   to "False" causing the update to fail

This update does not fix the concurrent issues ongoing with Windows, PPM is not yet optimized for Windows and no
uninstaller is made available yet. Follow the documentation on how to uninstall PPM.

Updating PPM from 1.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.1 simply requires you to run the installer, previous package installations/packages
will be backwards compatible with this version and it will work as expected.
