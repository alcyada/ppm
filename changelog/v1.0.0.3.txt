This update introduces bug fixes

 - Fixed AutoIndexer cache permission issue
 - Fixed compiler issue where when compiling mal-formed UTF-8 files fails, fixed the issue using a fallback
   byte-compiler method which will now introduce the header "byte_compiled" in a compiled file
   which will contain all the byte-compiled files instead of holding them in the "compiled_components" header

Updating PPM from 1.0.0.+ to 1.0.0.3 simply requires you to run the installer, previous package installations/packages
will be backwards compatible with this version and it will work as expected. Packages that failed to install correctly
due to the compiler bug will be required to be recompiled so that the issue can be corrected.
